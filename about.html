        <p><b>Introduction:</b></p>
        <p>This website is an overview of the findings of the Honors Thesis completed by Claire Pishko and Haley Harelson, students from Arizona State University’s Barrett, the Honors College. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, life for many individuals changed drastically. As students, Claire and Haley felt the effects of social isolation and loneliness, as all of their courses and extracurriculars were transitioned to remote. As they adapted to their new reality, they recognized that this change impacted others more severely than it did themselves, particularly older adults. Claire and Haley joined the social isolation group under Dr. Bradley Doebbeling in order to better understand the causes and effects of social isolation. They were hopeful to undercover successful resources for individuals to combat feelings of social isolation and loneliness.</p>
        <p>Claire joined the project aiming to better understand the effects of social isolation and loneliness on health outcomes. She will graduate from ASU's Barrett, the Honors College in May of 2022 with a B.S. in Biochemistry with a minor in Mathematics.</p>
        <p>Haley joined the project with the goal of learning data analysis techniques. This project has allowed her to analyze qualitative and quantitative data sets and perform complex data visualizations. She will graduate from ASU's Barrett, the Honors College in May of 2022 with a B.S. in Data Science on the Computer Science track.</p>
        <p>This Honors Thesis was completed in conjunction with faculty members from ASU’s College of Health Solutions and our primary mentors, Dr. Bradley Doebbeling and Dr. Maurico Meja. This research study aimed to further understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted loneliness in older adults, age 50+. The study examined ways older adults maintained social connectedness and overcame loneliness during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p><b>Background:</b></p>
            <p>What is social isolation? Social isolation is “a state in which the individual lacks a sense of belonging socially, lacks engagement with others, has a minimal number of social contacts, and are deficient in fulfilling and quality relationships” (Nicholson, 2009 p. 1346). 
            <p>Who suffers from social isolation? 24% of community-dwelling adults age 65 and older experience social isolation (Cudjoe et al., 2020)
            <p>What is loneliness?</p>
                <p>Loneliness is “the perception of social isolation or the subjective feeling of being lonely (National Academies of Sciences, 2020). Before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, 43% of adults age 60 and older reported feelings of loneliness (Perrissinotto et al., 2012). In this 2012 study by Perrissinotto et al., loneliness was a predictor of functional decline and death in older adults over the age of 60. For example, in participants categorized as "lonely" had a 24.8% decline in activities of daily living versus a 12.5% decline in "not lonely" participants (Perrissinotto et al., 2012).</p>
                <p>Improving social connections requires addressing both social isolation and loneliness (National Academy of Sciences, 2020)</p>
        <p>Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation and loneliness were well-defined and were generally understood to have adverse affects on generalized health. However, the start of the COVID-19 pandemic with strict stay at home orders made it abundantly clear that we need to better understand and respond to social isolation and loneliness as public health priorities (Smith and Lim, 2020). Pre-COVID-19 pandemic studies' estimates of social isolation and loneliness vary on a cases to case basis. The data is somewhat inconsistent, showing a range of one-in-six individuals feeling lonely to one-in-four people feeling lonely. The lack of knowledge about the extent of these conditions indicates the need for further, more extensive, research on the topic.</p>
            </p>
        <p><b>Significance:</b></p>
            <p>Loneliness and social isolation are associated with a 26% and 29% increased risk of mortality, respectively (Holt-Lunstad et al. 2015). Risk of social isolation on mortality is comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day and exceeds the risks obesity.</p>
            <p>Social isolation leads to increased risk of the following:
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardiovascular disease</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious illness</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Functional decline and disability</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malnutrition</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depression & anxiety</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dementia</p>
                </p>
            <p>Social isolation increases:
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ER Utilization</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare provider visits</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital admissions</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admission to long term care facilities</p>
            <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing further heightened risk of social isolation and loneliness (Smith et al., 2020). Social distancing was enacted to limit disease transmission indluding shelter-in-place orders, stay-at-home-orders, physical distancing, as well as others. During the pandemic, social isolation decreased risk of COVID-19 infection, but significantly impacted individuals' feelings of social isolation and loneliness. These guidelines created a social connectivity paradox (Smith et al., 2020) where older adults had to avoid the people, places, and services they rely upon for companionship, support and resources.

            <p><b>Methods:</b></p>
            <p>This Honors Thesis utilized two primary data sets. The first set of data was collected by a group of faculty within the Center for Innovation in Healthy and Resilient Aging at Arizona State University. This study researched how COVID-19 and the resulting physical/social distancing impacted aging individuals' health, wellbeing, and quality-of-life. The study involved a brief 15-25-minute online survey regarding participants’ social connections, health, and experiences during COVID-19. Scales such as the UCLA and Promise scores were used as standard measurements of social isolation and loneliness. These scales are defined below:</p>
            <p><u>UCLA Loneliness Scale:</u> A 20-item scale designed to measure one’s subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Participants rate each item as either O (“I often feel this way”), S (“I sometimes feel this way”), R (“I rarely feel this way”), N (“I never feel this way”).</p>
            <p>For more information on the UCLA Loneliness Scale click <a href="https://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/stories/pdf/selfmeasures/Self_Measures_for_Loneliness_and_Interpersonal_Problems_VERSION_3_UCLA_LONELINESS.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
            <p><u>PROMIS Social Isolation Score:</u> The PROMIS Social Isolation item bank assesses perceptions of being avoided, excluded, detached, disconnected from, or unknown by, others. The item bank does not use a time frame (e.g. over the past seven days) when assessing social isolation.</p>
            <p>For more information on the PROMIS Social Isolation Score click <a href="https://staging.healthmeasures.net/images/promis/manuals/PROMIS_Social_Isolation_Scoring_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
        <p>
            The second set of data was collected from a group of older adults, aged 50+. Participation involved a 30-45 minute telephone-based interview. A series of questions regarding the interviewees’ experiences with loneliness and isolation during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We were particularly interested in hearing about successful strategies for maintaining social connectedness and decreasing loneliness. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim and verified for accuracy.
            The target audience for the findings of this study are older adults, aged 50+, who are experiencing feelings of social isolation and/or loneliness. Outlined below is a visual essay including the findings of our two study methods. Additionally, resources to overcome feelings of loneliness and isolation based on the study findings are provided.
