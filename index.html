            This website is an overview of the findings of the Honors Thesis completed by Claire Pishko and Haley Harelson, students from Arizona State University’s Barrett, the Honors College. This Honors Thesis was completed in conjunction with faculty members from ASU’s College of Health Solutions and our primary mentors, Dr. Bradley Doebbeling and Dr. Maurico Meja. This research study aimed to further understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted loneliness in older adults, age 50+. The study examined ways older adults maintained social connectedness and overcame loneliness during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
This Honors Thesis utilized two primary data sets. The first set of data was collected by a group of faculty within the Center for Innovation in Healthy and Resilient Aging at Arizona State University. This study researched how COVID-19 and the resulting physical/social distancing impacted aging individuals' health, wellbeing, and quality-of-life. The study involved a brief 15-25-minute online survey regarding participants’ social connections, health, and experiences during COVID-19. Scales such as the UCLA and Promise scores were used as standard measurements of social isolation and loneliness. These scales are defined below:
UCLA Score: ***
Promise Score: ***
The second set of data was collected from a group of older adults, aged 50+. Participation involved a 30-45 minute telephone-based interview. A series of questions regarding the interviewees’ experiences with loneliness and isolation during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We were particularly interested in hearing about successful strategies for maintaining social connectedness and decreasing loneliness. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim and verified for accuracy.
The target audience for the findings of this study are older adults, aged 50+, who are experiencing feelings of social isolation and/or loneliness. Outlined below is a visual essay including the findings of our two study methods. Additionally, resources to overcome feelings of loneliness and isolation based on the study findings are provided.
