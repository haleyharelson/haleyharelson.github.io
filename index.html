            <p>
                Before analyzing key results from the data, we wanted to look at the demographics and composition
                of our survey sample. This helps us determine how representative our sample is of the entire 
                population (or not). Since we wanted to visualize the relationships between UCLA/PROMIS scores and 
                gender, race, and state, these were the particular demographics we looked at the percentages of.
                The bar chart below indicates that out of the 1,468 respondents who identified as male or female,
                about 87% were female while only about 13% were male.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to gender, we also analyzed race as a demographic in this sample. As illustrated below, 
                a vast majority of the respondents identified as white (about 96%), while less than 1% of respondents
                identified as any other race. Roughly 2% identified as "other", meaning they did not feel that the other
                options accurately identified their race.
            </p>            
            <svg id="racePercentageSvg"></svg>
            <p>
                Finally, we looked at the representation of states in the sample data (where the participants live). As shown
                by the bar chart below, the states with the largest percentages of respondents are Arizona (about 20%),
                California (about 12%), and Ohio (roughly 3.5%). In contrast, less than 1% of respondents reported as living
                in Vermont or North Dakota, and less than 0.1% of respondents live in Wyoming.

                <b>More information about the UCLA and PROMIS scales:</b>
                <p>
                <b>UCLA: </b>Total score < 28 = No/Low Loneliness, total score 28 - 43 = Moderate Loneliness, and total score >43 = High Loneliness
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>PROMIS: </b>In a reference population (usually the US general population), mean of 50 with a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores represent poorer social health.

                Below is a lollipop chart which represents the average UCLA/PROMIS scores by gender. For both scales,
                the average score for males and females were very similar. For the UCLA scale, the average score for males
                was 49.09, while the average score for females was 48.79. For the PROMIS scale, the average score for males
                was 48.74, while the average score for females was 49.53. According to the UCLA scale, both females and males
                reported high loneliness, while according to the PROMIS scale, females and males reported about average social health.

                Below is another lollipop chart representing the average UCLA/PROMIS scores by race. Pacific Islander respondents
                had the highest average UCLA score (56.33), followed by respondents who identified as "other" (51.5), multi-racial
                respondents (49.63), white respondents (48.85), Asian respondents (46.71), and black respondents (43.22). These 
                scores all fall into the "high loneliness" range of the UCLA scale. For the PROMIS scale, Pacific Islander respondents
                again reported the highest score (55.2), followed by multi-racial respondents (51.59) and those who identified as "other" (50.27), then
                by white respondents (49.45), Asian respondents (48.77), and black respondents (45.08). According to the PROMIS 
                scale, the scores for Pacific Islander, multi-racial, and "other" respondents are higher than average, the scores for 
                white and Asian respondents are about average, and the score for black respondents is a little below average.

                Using a choropleth map, we analyzed the average UCLA score by state. We can see that the 5 states reporting the highest 
                loneliness are Maryland (53.69), Arkansas (53.11), Mississippi (52.13), Florida (51.64), and Virginia (51.36). The 5 states
                reporting the lowest loneliness are North Dakota (43), Iowa (43.71), Rhode Island (44), South Carolina (45.11), and Hawaii (45.5). All 
                50 states had scores >= 43, which translates to "high loneliness" according to the UCLA scale.

                Using another choropleth map, we analyzed the average PROMIS score by state. The 5 states reporting the highest 
                social isolation are Wyoming (56.1), Nebraska (54.03), Maryland (53.37), Vermont (52.57), and Arkansas (52.16). 
                The 5 states reporting the lowest social isolation are Hawaii (45.7), Louisiana (45.38), Rhode Island (43.93), Idaho (43.56), and North Dakota (34.8).
                42% of states had PROMIS scores that indicate higher than average social isolation.

                The survey data revealed differences and similarities in social isolation and loneliness across different demographics
                in the sample. We then looked at the data from the interviews and coded transcripts to identify which strategies 
                were discussed more often as helping to combat social isolation and loneliness during COVID-19.
