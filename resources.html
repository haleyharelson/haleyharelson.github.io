    <p>After qualitative analysis of the participant interviews, we identified that individuals who successfully overcame feelings of isolation and loneliness took up new hobbies and acitivies. Below are several virtual acitivies including virtual museums, virtual cooking classes, and virtual gardening classes.</p>
            <hr>  
            <p><b><font size="+1">Virtual Museums:</font></b><p>
                    <p> <a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/"style="color: black">The Louvre, Paris</a> </p>
                    <p>While not a full virtual tour, almost the entire Louvre collection is now available for viewing online. You can view more than 480,000 works of art for free on the new platform, Louvre Collections, which is updated on a daily basis. Users have the ability to explore by collection and filter to discover some of the world’s most precious paintings, as well as sculptures, inscriptions, objects, textiles and artists.</p>
                    <p> <a href="https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/tour-virtuali-elenco.html"style="color: black">Sistine Chapel, Vatican Museums, Rome</a> </p>
                    <p>The virtual tour of the Sistine Chapel allows users to place themselves in the chapel, which is inside the pope’s official palace residence, and get a more complete impression of how it would be for real. You can even take a tour guide option to wander around the Vatican City and really ramp up the virtual experience</p>
                    <p> <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/nasa"style="color: black">NASA, Washington DC</a> </p>
                    <p>This experience gives a glimpse into how the US government agency that deals with National Aeronautics and Space Administration operates. There’s some incredible video footage on it’s website’s Galleries page of test-firing launch systems and missions to the moon, plus you can see a number of exhibitions online</p>
                    <p> <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/galleries-and-museum-map/museum-trails.html"style="color: black">Natural History Museum, London</a> </p>
                    <p>There’s pretty much something for everyone at the Natural History Museum: a 360-degree tour of the Fantastic Beasts exhibition, a gallery full of extraordinary Photographer of the Year images, as well as an up-close experience with Hope the blue whale – with audio guides by the reassuringly knowledgeable Sir David Attenborough. What’s even better is every Tuesday at 3pm you can spend time with a scientist online, and take part in interactive discussions.</p>
                    <p> <a href="http://www.bcn.cat/museupicasso/en/visiting/virtual-tours.html"style="color: black">Picasso Museum, Barcelona</a> </p>
                    <p>A very uplifting way to bring a piece of Spain into your living room. Picasso was born in Málaga, but he spent many of his formative years in Barcelona, so many of his most important pieces are housed in this museum. A heady virtual stroll takes in works from his Blue and Rose periods, as well as his series of insightful reinterpretations of Velázquez’s Las Meninas. There are separate tours of the place’s pretty, plant-strewn courtyard and the various places where Picasso lived and worked.</p>
                    <p> <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/the-british-museum"style="color: black">The British Museum, London</a> </p>
                    <p>No stone (literally) has been left unturned when it comes to exploring the British Museum from home, with a staggering 60-plus galleries to visit via Google Street View. Virtual collections on the museum site cover Oceania, with art and artefacts from the South Pacific islands, and a large selection of prints and drawings. Special online shows worth seeing, meanwhile, include the recent Arctic: Culture and Climate exhibition</p>
                    <p> <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/project/guggenheim-bilbao"style="color: black">Guggenheim Bilbao Museum, Spain</a> </p>
                    <p>So in early 2021 you can't hop over to San Sebastián for some pintxos on a trip to Bilbao, but you will can see this brilliantly designed Frank Gehry museum with an interactive tour that shows a mesmerising video of a photographer catching a free runner scaling the outside of the building before exploring its outstanding modern art collection, with paintings by greats from Mark Rothko and Yves Klein to Willem de Kooning and Anselm Kiefer.</p>
                    <p> <a href="Uffizi.it"style="color: black">Uffizi Gallery, Florence</a> </p>
                    <p>This powerhouse of a gallery is home to too many Renaissance greats to mention, but its selection of curated tours goes some way to conjuring up the magic of the Uffizi experience – and the upside is you don’t have to queue behind hordes of visitors to see Leonardo da Vinci’s Annunciation or Botticelli’s The Birth Of Venus. You can look up paintings or take a virtual stroll through various parts of the museum, and there are also video stories on lesser-known artists and educational projects.</p>
                    <p> <a href="Stockholm360.net"style="color: black">The Vasa Museum, Stockholm</a> </p>
                    <p>The behemoth Vasa ship, seen on entering this museum in Stockholm in real life, is one of the most striking pieces of history in the city, and it remains the best preserved example of a 17th-century vessel worldwide – retrieved after it sank in harbour waters in 1628. The audio guides online go through the history of the ship, along with realistic background sounds of the moment it sank, as well as up-close images and a historical timeline of events.</p>
                    <p> <a href="Annefrank.org"style="color: black">Anne Frank House, Amsterdam</a> </p>
                    <p>Anne Frank’s name is indelibly inked in history books as a result of her evocative World War II diaries, published after her death. This is a fascinating, if unsettling, tour around the museum dedicated to her attic hiding place, where she stayed to escape from the Nazis – something she managed until she was found and transported to a concentration camp, aged just 15. The site also has photographic footage of her childhood, along with extracts from her diaries.</p>
                    <p> <a href="moma.org"style="color: black">MOMA, New York<a/a> </p>
                    <p>Manhattan’s awe-inspiring museum of modern art has a huge online display of work, from paintings and design to sculpture, architecture and film, including virtual views of Van Gogh’s Starry Night, the Surrealist Women exhibition and the gallery's Sculpture Garden. The New York, Open City video is a must for an immersive and historic NY experience. If you sign up to MOMA’s newsletter you can be updated on specific virtual events and live Q&As. </p>

                    <p>Built in 1964, this museum is dedicated to the archaeology and history of Mexico’s pre-Hispanic heritage. There are 23 exhibit rooms filled with ancient artifacts, including some from the Mayan civilization.</p>

      <p>Skype is software that enables the world's conversations. Millions of individuals and businesses use Skype to make free video and voice one-to-one and group calls, send instant messages and share files with other people on Skype. You can use Skype on whatever works best for you – on your mobile, computer or tablet. Skype is free to download and easy to use.</p>
                  <p> Click <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/"style="color: black">here<a/a> to download Skype</p>
                  <p>How To Use Skype:
                      <p>Step 1: Download the software. Depending on which device you plan to use, you'll download a specific version of Skype.</p>
                      <p>Step 2: Create your username. Come up with a username and password you can easily remember. Then, share your name with your family and friends so they're ready to receive your calls and reach out to you on their own.</p>
                      <p>Step 3: Set up your contact list. Once you've given out your Skype username, ask your loved ones for their usernames. You can easily add them after logging on by clicking the Contacts tab on the left hand side, then the "Add Contact" button in the top right-hand corner.</p>
                      <p>Step 4: Select your call type. After creating your contact list, you'll be ready to make your first Skype call. Select a family member or friend to call by clicking on his or her picture. You'll then see a series of buttons and you'll decide which kind of call you'd like to make. You can choose between video calls (click the video button if you want to communicate face-to-face) and phone calls (click the phone button if you want to make a call without using the webcam). You'll notice a "+" button as well, which allows you to add other loved ones to the conversation. This is especially convenient when you're trying to get the whole family together on the call!</p>
                      <p>Step 5: Make sure you're connected. If you've made the call and you can't see or hear the other person, there might be an issue with the connection. Click the call quality icon to make sure you and your loved one have strong enough internet connection to interact.</p>
                      <p>Step 6: Talk for as long as you want! Once the connection is strong you'll have a full screen of his or her picture and a small square of your own in the bottom right corner. Now you can talk the day away! Skype makes connecting with your loved ones a simple task, regardless of the distance.</p>
                      <p>Step 7: End the call. Once you've finished the call, simply press the red handset icon to end the conversation and close out of the program.</p>

                      <p><b><font size="+1">WhatsApp:</font></b></p>
      <p>Launched in 2009, WhatsApp is a free, multi-platform messaging app that lets users make video and voice calls, send text messages, share their status, and more with just a Wi-Fi connection. Part of what makes this app appealing is that it works on various phone and computer operating systems, so you can continue your conversation anytime, anywhere. It can also take advantage of Wi-Fi and cellular data to make one-on-one or group calls, reducing the need for expensive calling charges.</p>
                  <p> Click <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download"style="color: black">here<a/a> to download WhatsApp</p>
                  <p>How To Use WhatsApp:
                      <p>Step 1: Install WhatsApp. Install the app from the Play Store (Android) or App Store (iPhone).Launch the app and approve the requested permissions. Enter your phone number and tap Confirm. Enter the verification code received via SMS (WhatsApp may do this automatically). Import existing contacts into the app (optional).</p>
                      <p>Step 2: Set up your WhatsApp profile. Tap the three dots in the top-right corner of the app and tap Settings. Tap your name at the top of the screen. To change your picture, tap the camera icon and select a photo. To change your name, tap the pencil icon next to Name. Enter or adjust your bio by tapping the pencil icon next to About.</p>
                      <p>Step 3: Start a chat. Now that your profile is set, it’s time to get to the task at hand: chatting! The first time you open the app you won’t have any chats open, but you can start a new chat by tapping on the chat bubble in the bottom right. From there, simply select the contact you want to chat with from the list. If you already have a previous chat with that contact, it will open that instead of a brand new chat. All that’s left now is to type your message at the bottom of the screen. After entering your text, tap the arrow icon that appears alongside the text box to send it. You can also send pictures or files on WhatsApp by tapping the paperclip or camera icons at the bottom of the screen. WhatsApp has a built-in camera app, but it’s better to use your normal camera app to take the picture and select it in the gallery to send.</p>
                      <p>Step 4: Start a call. One of the most useful features when using WhatsApp internationally is the ability to make phone calls. Unlike standard international voice calls, WhatsApp calls use your internet connection rather than your phone line, so they’re completely free (barring any data overage charges when not on Wi-Fi). To start a phone call on WhatsApp, all you need to do is open a chat window and tap the phone icon in the top right. If it’s a group, you can even select multiple people to call at the same time.</p>
